## Creating a Django Project
### Django Project Initialization
1. Create a new folder with the project name ```shopey```
2. Create a Python Virtual Environment on that folder using this command in PowerShell:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   ```
3. Activate the Virtual Environment using this command:
   ```bash
   env/Scripts/Activate
   ```
4. Create a new requirements.txt in that folder, and fill it with:
   ```
   django
   gunicorn
   whitenoise
   psycopg2-binary
   requests
   urllib3
   ```
5. Install the dependencies with env using this command:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
6. Create the Django Project using this command:
   ```bash
   django-admin startproject shopey .
   ```
### Routing
7. Route the project to localhost, add this to ALLOWED_HOSTS in settings.py:
   ```
   ...
   ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["localhost", "127.0.0.1"]
   ...
   ```
8. Ensure that my Django project has been successfully made and ported locally by running:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
   , access http://localhost:8000/ and check the flying rocket animation.
